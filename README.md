# XAI_on_Housing_data
This project demonstrates how to build and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict house prices using the King County House Sales dataset. It goes beyond simple prediction by incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
