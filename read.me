🏡 House Price Prediction with Explainable AI (XAI)
A deep learning regression project that predicts house prices using the King County House Sales dataset. This project emphasizes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP and LIME to demystify model predictions and help users understand feature influence.

It also includes an interactive real-time simulation using sliders for intuitive exploration of model behavior.

🚀 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing

Cleans, normalizes, and prepares housing data

Handles missing values and scales input features

✅ Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

TensorFlow/Keras-based regression model

Uses dropout layers to reduce overfitting

✅ Training & Evaluation

Tracks training/validation loss over epochs

Plots predictions vs actual prices to assess accuracy

✅ Explainability via XAI

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Global and local feature importance

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): Explains individual predictions

Interactive IML Interface: Real-time price predictions using ipywidgets

✅ Comparative Analysis

Evaluates SHAP, LIME, and IML based on:

Fidelity (accuracy of explanation model)

Unambiguity (clarity and consistency)

Interpretability (ease of human understanding)

📊 Key Analyses
🔧 1. Model Training & Evaluation
ANN with Dense + Dropout layers trained to predict house prices.

Visualized loss curves to monitor training behavior.

Scatter plot of predicted vs actual prices indicates strong model performance.

💡 2. Explainable AI (XAI)
🔍 SHAP (Global + Local Explanations)
Identifies key features influencing predictions.

Top features: sqft_living, grade, and lat.

🧠 LIME (Local Interpretations)
Provides intuitive breakdown for a single prediction.

Shows which features increased or decreased a specific house's price.

SHAP offers the best unambiguity (9/10) and consistent global explanations but has a high fidelity score (192.4B) and moderate interpretability (7/10).
LIME provides the best fidelity (7.35B) with good interpretability (8/10) and decent unambiguity (7/10).
IML (Interactive Model) isn't directly measurable for fidelity, but excels in interpretability (9/10) while scoring lower on unambiguity (5/10).

SHAP offers the most consistent global explanations.

LIME provides the best fidelity for individual predictions.

IML (interactive model with sliders) is easiest for human interpretation.
